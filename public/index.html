<p><strong>Nielsen Privacy and Consent Notice</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Effective March 2017</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you for agreeing to join Nielsen&rsquo;s select group of panelists. By allowing Nielsen to utilize the images and feedback on the Visicooler, Shelf display and corresponding invoices that you transmit through the facebook messenger application on your device, to help Nielsen&rsquo;s [</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">insert the services</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">].&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nielsen safeguards your identity. We are very protective of your information. Nielsen will NOT use your personal identifying information to advertise, promote, or market third-party goods or services directly to you. We will not license, publish or sell your name, email address, postal address, or mobile phone number. We use tools and methods to make sure that there is no reasonable possibility of identifying an individual in the reports that we create for our clients.&nbsp;</span></p>

By sharing your responses you explicitly consent to Nielsen using the responses in the manner envisaged and required herein for the furtherance of the services performed by Nielsen. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nielsen Survey&rsquo;s Do Not Contain Any Spyware or Adware&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We do not serve pop-up or pop-under advertising through the facebook messenger application and we do not install hidden, ad-supported programs onto users' mobile phones.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Collection and Use</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Personally identifying information" means information that by itself &ndash; like your first and last name or personal email address &ndash; or in combination with other information could identify a specific individual.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We receive information such as:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">* Name&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">* Home Address&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">* Work Address&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">* Email Address&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">* Phone Number&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">* IMEI/IMSI/ESN&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">* Date of Birth&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">* Product details</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An example of the information collected is as follows:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pictures of Visicoolers which are the assets of the Soft drink and may be provided specifically by a particular company.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pictures from the shelf display or window display. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pictures of the company specific invoices and bills generated at the time of sales.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you respond to survey questions that are presented to you as a result of your participation as a panelist, the information you provide will be collected and used.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nielsen does not listen to or record any of your phone calls. We also do not examine, store or record any of the contents of text or picture messages you send or receive, except as specifically shared with us. In addition, we do not read any of the contents of your other files or email messages stored on your mobile device.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We use the information collected to perform research and to prepare aggregated reports and analyses about the concept of self-sourcing using a facebook chat. These include, for example, reports and analyses based on combined information that does not identify individual people. We may also use your behavior data to create statistical models of people that look like you and that we believe are likely to have the same interests and behaviors as you. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sharing Your Information</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As noted above, we do not provide our clients with any of the personally identifying information or collect from metering your device, nor do we ever use this information for direct marketing purposes. We use tools and methods to make sure that there is no reasonable possibility of identifying an individual in the reports that we create for our clients. For example, we combine the data we collect from your mobile phone with the data of others to produce "aggregated" reports.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Occasionally we work with other companies for the purposes of data processing or market research product development purposes. Companies that are given access to your information in connection with providing services for us are contractually required to keep that information confidential and are not permitted to use this information for any other purpose except to carry out the services that they are performing for us.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may release personally identifying information to third parties when disclosure is required by law or when necessary or desirable to exercise or preserve our legal rights, or to take action regarding potentially illegal activities, or to protect the safety or rights of any person or legal entity.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If all or part of Nielsen is sold, merged or otherwise transferred to an unrelated entity, your information, whether personally identifying or otherwise, may be transferred as part of that transaction.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Security</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The security of data and the protection of personal information are essential to our success and credibility. We have in place certain security measures, including encryption methods and access protocols, to help protect the security and confidentiality of personally identifying information while controlled by us. We store your information for as long as needed for our research and analyses purposes and in accordance with law. Your information may be stored in the United States or elsewhere but in any event will be stored using administrative, managerial and technical measures to protect its confidentiality. Please remember that storage and communication of personal data cannot always be one-hundred percent secure.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Updates to This Privacy Notice</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We reserve the right to update and make changes to this Privacy Notice and to our practices in collecting and handling personally identifying information. If we make a material change (the kind of change to the way we use your information that might make you reconsider participating in this panel), we will notify you by either sending a message to the most recent email address you gave us or sending a message to your mobile phone via the facebook messenger. We will notify you at least 30 days before we plan to make a material change to give you time to resign from the panel if you want.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Your continued membership in this panel after the effective date of any changes constitutes your acceptance of all of the changes.&nbsp;</strong></p>
